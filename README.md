# EXPERIMENTS




## Run the algorithm 20 times, for each run it reports in which generation the strongest chromosome was found.strongest chromosome was found. Reports the average of this value

## Run the same experiment, but this time without crossover (pc = 0, pm = 0.001).


## Run the same experiment, but this time without mutation (pc = 0.7, pm = 0).

##  Run the same experiment, but this time with these values:

# pc = 0.9, pm = 0.001
# pc = 0.3, pm = 0.001

## Which is the best choice of parameters according to the results obtained above? Why?


## Run the algorithm 20 times, for each run it reports in which generation the strongest chromosome was found.strongest chromosome was found. It reports the average of this value. Vary the population size. Test with 50, 100, 500, 1000 chromosomes. Which is the best choice? Why?

## Run the algorithm for 100 generations and plot the best, worst and average fitness function found in each generation vs. the number of generations.
