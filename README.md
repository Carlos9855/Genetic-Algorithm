# Problem Description
There are several generations of chromosomes from which the chromosome with the highest fitness function has to be found using a genetic algorithm which contains a crossover probability and a mutation probability.

# Solution Description
For the solution of this problem were used four classes Chromosome, generation GeneticLocalSearch, settings that help to find the solution with the different poblations, probabilities of mutation and crossover 
the solve consists in 

# Running the script


# EXPERIMENTS




## Run the algorithm 20 times, for each run it reports in which generation the strongest chromosome was found.strongest chromosome was found. Reports the average of this value

Pc: 0.7 Pm: 0.001

## Run the same experiment, but this time without crossover (pc = 0, pm = 0.001).


## Run the same experiment, but this time without mutation (pc = 0.7, pm = 0).

## Which is the best choice of parameters according to the results obtained above? Why?



## Run the algorithm 20 times, for each run it reports in which generation the strongest chromosome was found.strongest chromosome was found. It reports the average of this value. Vary the population size. Test with 50, 100, 500, 1000 chromosomes. Which is the best choice? Why?

## Run the algorithm for 100 generations and plot the best, worst and average fitness function found in each generation vs. the number of generations.
